     * Upgrading to fltk2 r6858 which comes with a modified license which

    Notes:
     * With the required X11-related libs installed, Alien::FLTK builds and
         tests just fine on my Xubuntu box but I've received nothing but
         FAIL-mail from CPAN Testers on non-Win32 systems. ...I'll take
         suggestions from any *nix knowledgeable person who'd like to help.
